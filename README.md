Hi Aviral this side...
This is my simple project of game of rock paper scissors. As we all are familiar, its a 2-player game where both player have to choose any one from the 3 choice - rock, paper or scissors.
Rules: Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beat Paper.
Directions: Just click any one of the three buttons appearing on the screen to make your move. once you make a move the computer also randomly generates a move.
